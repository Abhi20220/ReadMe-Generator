# ReadMe-Generator

## Description
My project is a ReadMe Generator. The purpose of this project is to help a user generate a ReadMe using a list of questions within a terminal. Not only this but it is easier to use. 

This ReadMe generator will allow the user to create a professional ReadMe document within a couple of minutes without worry about any of the syntax.
